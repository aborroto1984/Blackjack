# Blackjack
Black Jack was a project developed in Visual Studios using C#. 
It is a console application where you can play the blackjack game against the computer 
using a simple betting system where you start the game with $2000 and place bets before 
the game starts. While writing this project, I used Object Oriented Programming to write 
the Hand, Card, Deck, and Game classes. The factory design pattern is also applied to 
construct the card objects.
